Using AI to forecast Thrombosis

This work has as objective to create an AI model that based on the patients data predict the occurrence of thrombosis. 
Therefore our objective is to create a tool capable of based on ten patient parameters 
(eleven if we count the IMC which is obtained based on two of the ten) predict the occurrence of thrombosis. 
Note that although we have two types of thrombosis (Identified as TEP and TVP in the database) we are going to consider just
 a binary outbut: thrombosis or no thrombosis. 
Therefore we have a situation where regardless the patient had one or the two types the model predict Thrombosis
